excerpt: "A poem for when your dreams feel too far fetched. Just know that even the baby steps do count!"

Note - When your dreams feel too far fetched just know that even the baby steps do count! I was inspired to write this poem after I saw a comic by @sarahandersencomics on instagram.

Here's the poem - 

One day, <br />
All those baby steps will take you <br />
To where you truly belong. <br />
The little things you do, <br />
Will soon pay off. <br />
It may take you a while. <br />
The path may be long. <br />
It may set you off track. <br />
But be patient <br />
You'll get there. <br />
As long as you don't just stand there <br />
Even the smallest of steps does count. <br />
Come on now, <br />
Set course and steer straight ahead. <br />
The bumps and bruises, <br />
Along the way, <br />
Are a small price to pay. <br />
For what you seek <br />
Is what most are afraid of. <br />
Don't let their fear get to you. <br />
Don't you ever stop trying. <br />
Be it a stride or a leap, <br />
Even the baby steps do count. <br />
