I am a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I am fortunate to work with [Chetan Bansal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chetanb/){:target="_blank"} on using Machine Learning techniques to aid the Software Developement process. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya, [Dr. Subho Mukherjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/submukhe/), [Dr. Nachi Nagappan](https://nachinagappan.github.io/) and [Dr. Tom Zimmermann](http://thomas-zimmermann.com/) on several projects. 

Prior to the fellowship, I attended [PES University](https://cs.pes.edu/) (previously known as PES Institute of Technology or PESIT) where I obtained a Bachelor's in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science in 2019. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Gowri Srinivasa](https://faculty.pes.edu/p10019) on my Bachelor's thesis. 

My interests broadly lie in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning for Software Engineering. Some related topics that have caught my attention are Data Mining, Web Search Query Analysis and Information Retrival.

In my free time, I like to read, write, draw and do yoga.
