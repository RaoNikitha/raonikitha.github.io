I am a first year PhD student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu), School of Computer Science, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) where I am adviced by [Dr. Vincent Hellendoorn](https://vhellendoorn.github.io){:target="_blank"}. My interests broadly lie in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and Machine Learning for Software Engineering. 

Previously, I spent two years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Chetan Bansal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chetanb/){:target="_blank"} on using Machine Learning techniques to aid the Software Developement process. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya, [Dr. Subho Mukherjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/submukhe/), [Dr. Nachi Nagappan](https://nachinagappan.github.io/) and [Dr. Tom Zimmermann](http://thomas-zimmermann.com/) on several projects. 

Prior to the fellowship, I attended [PES University](https://cs.pes.edu/) where I obtained a Bachelor's in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science in 2019. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Gowri Srinivasa](https://faculty.pes.edu/p10019) on my Bachelor's thesis. 


In my free time, I like to play the piano, read, write and draw.
