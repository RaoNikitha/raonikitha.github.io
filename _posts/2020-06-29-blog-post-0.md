excerpt: "It is easier for someone to identify Picasso's painting than drawing one. Generative models, which are known for generating or creating data, are considered much more difficult to build and train when compared to discriminative models, which are known for processing the data. We will understand the working of GANs and discuss some of the problems that commonly arise when training GANs."

It is easier for someone to identify Picasso's painting than drawing one. Generative models, which are known for generating or creating data, are considered much more difficult to build and train when compared to discriminative models, which are known to process the data. We will understand the working of GANs and discuss the process involved in training. We will also try to understand why training a GAN is hard and how many of the GAN models suffer from major problems such as non convergence, mode collapse, diminished gradient to name a few. We then address the problem of mode collapse and look at some of the ways in which we can overcome this problem. This is followed by an in-depth discussion on the working of PacGAN and Unrolled GANS as solutions to the mode collapse problem.
